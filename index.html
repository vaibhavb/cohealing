<h1><a id="about">About</a></h1>
As humanity undergoes a transformation, we are each being challenged to move beyond outdated, limiting beliefs and behaviors in order to evolve and achieve a new version of ourselves and our collective world. Cohealing is a  community meditation group, where we are singularly focused on exploring well-being and making self-care practices accessible to all, especially within communities where the need is greatest (which is now!). Cohealing is an enabler. This meditation & restoration experience aims to show you how, by directing your attention within, you can build resilience, find healing, and create a new version of your life and our shared world.

We are grateful to have you as part of our meditation community

    In early 2020, I was dealing with chronic pain and felt immense stress and the string of events following added a whole lot to it. I created a self healing plan that worked for me and got me to a better place today. A succession of difficult events led me to cogitate a lot, introducing me to meditation. With consistent meditation, I became more mindful. I’m learning the art of being present, less reactive, which overall helped me maintain my sanity in the toughest moments. I learnt to build necessary routines involving physical exercise and meditation to stay healthy, and mindful. I intend to practice those habits, and make them second nature rather than conscious endeavors. As Aristotle stated, “Excellence is not an act, but a habit”.
