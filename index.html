                As humanity undergoes a transformation, we are each being challenged to move beyond outdated, limiting beliefs and behaviors in order to evolve and achieve a new version of ourselves and our collective world. Cohealing is a  community meditation group, where we are singularly focused on exploring well-being and making self-care practices accessible to all, especially within communities where the need is greatest (which is now!). Cohealing is an enabler. This meditation & restoration experience aims to show you how, by directing your attention within, you can build resilience, find healing, and create a new version of your life and our shared world.

                We are grateful to have you as part of our meditation community

            <p>In early 2020, I was dealing with chronic pain and felt immense stress and the string of events following added a whole lot to it. I created a self healing plan that worked for me and got me to a better place today. A succession of difficult events led me to cogitate a lot, introducing me to meditation. With consistent meditation, I became more mindful. I’m learning the art of being present, less reactive, which overall helped me maintain my sanity in the toughest moments. I learnt to build necessary routines involving physical exercise and meditation to stay healthy, and mindful. I intend to practice those habits, and make them second nature rather than conscious endeavors. As Aristotle stated, “Excellence is not an act, but a habit”.</p>

            <p>A couple years ago, after an intense surgery, I found meditation to be the only lasting restful medicine that worked to calm my mind for long periods of time. As a former power Yogi, pain and frustration of not being able to move much at all led me to embrace the benefits of more restorative and gentle mind body practices. Frequent meditation helped me to heal more gracefully than I may have otherwise. Daily mindfulness allowed me to accept where I was, and know that I can consciously be present with where my mind and body are and be at peace with wherever that is. Activating the parasympathetic nervous system, I came out of this physical healing in one of the best and healthiest shapes of my life in multiple ways. I now seek the meditative qualities of grounding and rejuvenation in my Yoga.</p>
